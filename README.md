# logger_chan

A lazy attempt to making an auto logger for Authorized WiFis  
Built using Intuition, Intellisense and StackOverflow

## Uses

- Install the app
- Open, fill credentials and hit save.
- Then, you can log in and out using the buttons at the bottom (play and cross buttons for now)
- Expand your notification panel, go to edit (mostly a pen icon on the top or bottom of expanded notification bar),
and drag and drop the Logger Chan tile.
- Now you can login and logout from the WiFi network with a single tap on this icon just like you toggle WiFi or Mobile Network.

## Caveats (for now)

- ~The tile (notification bar icon button) needs to be configured for the first login usage. For now it may show wrong auth state.~
- When loggin in, mobile data should be off (most of the time it will work with Mobile data being on as well, but not always)
